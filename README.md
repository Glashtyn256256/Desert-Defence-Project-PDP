# Desert Defence

Desert defence was a prototype game collaborating with another developer and four artists. Defend the city walls by building turrets to help slay the enemy invaders, the more gold you have at the end will determine your place on the high score table.

Re-uploaded to my repository . Due to merging issue and lack of experience in Source Control at the time. Was decided to just use one GitHub account due to the short time frame which was why the commits were all made from one account.
